Design Questions

Referral Status -- why does referral_status_id work? (I found that this was an option in the referral dictionary)

How will Referral fit in with Action Items? Do we need to reconsider the class organization?

URL patterns of patient contact (that is, the first followup request for a specific referral does not take the number 1 but rather the next primary key available in the data base)

Should the follow up page (AKA patient contact) be changed?

Guidance on how to approach patient home page? That is, how should we incorporate the referral status and to-do list?

Process Questions

How can I check the database when I develop?

Testing?

Linter Questions

What is the best way to work with indentations? 

Google how to use spaces in Python

Debugging

Cannot delete referrals from admin page. Contradictory make migrations messages. 

Django Questions

primary_key = True, False
self.request.session
kwargs vs. args
views, line 32, 'name='?

Also, what will we do about new demographics code?
